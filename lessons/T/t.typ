			SPEED EXERCISES

From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  In the
drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.

What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.

If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

Try this sentence:

Sarah has liked knitting all her life.

Try a little longer sentence.

She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

When you type a multi-line paragraph, you will have to hit the RETURN-key at
the end of each line.

All the sane people in this area sold their gold
right at the start.  The insane ones held their
gold and later it paid off.


One fine afternoon the king had an idea.  He
sent a letter to all the lords and ladies of
his land.  He asked for a great feast.  His
people prepared roasts.  His jester did a jig.
All the people left hoping to do it again.

He/she should bring his/her spouse at about noon or just before.
Should I be here alone?  Is Bernie and/or Julie going to be here, too?

Try your speed on some paragraphs:

All bills are to be paid in full.  If
there is no fee to be paid, return the
bill and put n/a in the total due part.

You should be aiming for 15 WPM.  (If you did better, work on accuracy.)

In baseball, bunting is a kind of hit.  But, bunting also
refers to a kind of bird and the stuff that is used in
flags.  English sure is a strange language.

Use your ;-finger for the hyphen.

;;; ;-; ;;; --- ;;; ;-; ;;; ;-;


;;; one-third ;;; one-half ;;; three-fifths ;;;
;;; part-time ;;; self-made ;;; all-American ;;;

Let's try some sentences:

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.


Motion pictures often depict macabre scenes.


Once upon a time, marriages lasted longer than mortgages.
There are three uses of the hyphen.  It can be used to combine two words:

She had on a bluish-green dress.  But, no one noticed.

To divide a word:

At macrame class last night, I made a hanging basket for the philo-
dendron in our dining room.

Or, to form a dash:

Fifteen dollars a month--measured in current dollars--is a good rate.

Let's try a speed drill on these sentences:

The clock ran out, signaling the end of
the second-half.  The game had been lost.


The paper just made an announce-
ment about a commotion at the
college.  Someone has just
produced a micro-organism in the
DNA-research lab.  It is a
special kind of bacteria that
consumes crude oil.  The talk is
that it is being patented for use
on oil spills at sea.

Hit the return key twice for blank lines:

Dear Mr. Mandrake:

All of us appreciated the fine performance of those magic
tricks.  Please arrange to come to another of our meet-
ings, if possible.  Perhaps our Christmas meeting?

Thanks,

fff vat fff eve fff vow fff


fvf vine fvf dove fvf ever fvf very fvf


driven vertical advent ventrical
What a fine vineyard you have.
Do you intend to play adventure every night?


			THE BACKSPACE

Most of the programs that you use will allow you to correct your mistakes by
using the BACKSPACE and/or DELETE keys.  These keys will generally delete the
previous character that you typed.  (This feature is one of the principal
advantages of a word-processing system over a conventional typewriter.)

I refuse to accept either of these keys during a drill pattern.  (You should
keep practicing until you get it right!)  But, I will accept either a BACK-
SPACE or a DELETE during a speed drill.  (I will remove the white error
markers but I still count it as an error in my totals.)

If you do chose to use the DELETE or BACKSPACE keys, hit the key with your
;-finger and immediately return your fingers to the home position.

Let's try our speed on some nursery rhymes!

Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And every where that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.


Jack and Jill went up a hill to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after.


Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Eating her curds and whey.
Along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.


Hey, diddle diddle--
The cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.

Lesson T10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Lesson T10

Let's review the entire alphabet before starting the number keys.

abcd efg hijk lmnop qrs tuv wx yz

Once more

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Use the shift key for each letter (Do not use the CAPS LOCK key)

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Now, review the punctuations that you've had.

l;l l:l k,k l.l ;/; ;?; :?: ;-;



			NUMERIC KEYS

The terminal has two sets of numeric keys.  One set--directly above the
alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards.  The other
set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad.  In this typing series we
will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys on the main keyboard.
(If you would like to learn to touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series
lessons instead.)

NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad

The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
the same place on all typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
period keys.  We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
have a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.  If it does not,
you will have to use the L-key.

Let's start by using the 1-key, since we have one.  (Use your A-finger.)

aaa a1a aaa 111 aaa a1a


a1q qa1 qz1 az1 aq1 a1z
111 and 111 ate 111 any 111
If 11 men each catch 11 fish in 11 days, how many fish were caught?

Use your S-finger for the 2-key.

sss s2s sss s2s sss s2s


sss s2w sss 2xw sss w2x sss
222 saw 222 was 222 wet 222
The 2 men were 2 late 2 catch the 2 PM train.


Use your D-finger for the 3-key.

ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd


ddd d3e ddd d3c ddd e3c ddd
333 did 333 cat 333 eat 333
1 plus 2 is 3.  11 plus 22 is 33.  111 plus 222 is 333.

The last number we will practice today is the 4-key.  (Use your F-finger.)

fff f4f fff f4f fff f4f


fff f4r fff 4vr fff 4vr fff
444 for fff rat 444 vet 444
Flight 423 leaves from gate 42 at 4:24.
As the 3 musketeers say: 1 4 all, and all 4 1.
If 1/4 plus 2/3 is 11/12, what is 1/2 plus 1/3?

Try your speed on this line:

Our team won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place at the 12th annual outing.

As we stated earlier, many typewriters do not have a 1 key.  Let's practice
using the L-key as a 1, so you can use any kind of typewriter.

One dozen is l2.  A gross is l2 dozen or l44.


In both octal and decimal, ll times ll is l2l.  And, 3 minus 4 is -l.
But in octal, l2 is not divisible by 3.

Is flight number 377 for Florida a 727, a 737 or a 747?
It is a 727 with 4 stops.  With all those stops it takes almost 7 hours.

Use your K-finger for the 8-key.

kkk k8k kkk k8k kkk k8k kkk


kkk k8i kkk 8,i kkk ,i8 kkk
888 kick 888 sink 888 keep 888
Agent 88 was supposed to check in at 8:14.  She is 38 minutes late.
Her team was assigned to zone 8 of quadrant 828.  Send 8 more agents.

Use your L-finger for the 9-key.

lll 9.o lll o9. lll l9. lll
999 Jr. 999 log 999 old 999
Oh, 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
If 9 of us take 9 each, there will still be 18 left for the song.

Use your ;-finger for the 0-key.

;;; ;0; ;;; ;0; ;;; ;0; ;;;

000 a/c 000 pup 000 me? 000
Dear Sirs:  The 10:00 meeting on March 10 has been postponed until 10:30.
The 10:30 meeting was moved to 11:00 in Room 302.
But, Room 302 can only hold 10 people.  We will need Conference Room 10.

Let's try some paragraphs.

Zip codes are arranged so that the first 3 digits
designate the regional office and the last 2
digits designate the local branch.  The numbering
is roughly east to west.  That is, numbers
starting with 0 are in New England, numbers
starting with 1 are the New York area, etc.
There are notable exceptions to this rule,
however.  The Virgin Islands are south of
Florida, but their Zip Codes start with 00.


The new nine digit zip codes have upset quite a
few people.  It was bad enough being referred to
as 73218.  But now, we will have to remember
numbers like 73218-4208.  The worst hit will be
the companies whose mailing list programs were
poorly designed.  Those unstructured programs
will be very difficult to change.

If we want to catch the 6:15 flight to Phoenix (which is the
non-stop), we will have to leave by 5:00 at the latest (in
case we run into traffic).  Otherwise, we will have to take
the 6:45 flight (which makes 5 stops).

Use the main keyboard keys.  Don't cheat and use the auxilliary keypad!
Try entering straight numbers:

423 475 925 235 295 175 650

If you have completed Lessons T1 through T12, then you are now ready
to call yourself a touch typist.  You have learned to touch type all
of the keys which are standardized!  You can now begin the SPEED
series of lessons if you would like.  (If you come across a punctua-
tion symbol which you have not learned, simply look for it.  Use the
appropriate finger for the shifted numeric keys.  Use your ;-finger
for all the keys on the right-hand side.)

We will practice touch typing on the keyboard layout for the remaining
lessons.

In this lesson we will be practicing the special symbols which you will need
for BASIC or other programming languages.  I won't give you too much practice
with these symbols right now.  (You should be able to get plenty of exercise by
simply typing in programs.)

T16

                            Lesson T16



In this lesson we will be practicing the shifted numeric keys on the
terminal keyboard.  I will only be giving you practice in the keystroke
motions.  Very few sentence drills or speed exercises are included, since these
keys are used so infrequently.

If you are typing something which includes one of these special characters and
you cannot remember where a key is, look.  But, always make sure to hit the key
with the correct finger.  (If you do use the key often, you will eventually
learn where it is without looking.)  Since these keys are used infrequently and
are in different places on most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed
is not important.

Use your S-finger for the at-sign.

sss s@s sss s@s sss s@s sss


s@s at@ s@s w@x s@s S@w s@s
s@s wax s@s mix s@s @we s@s

Use your D-finger for the pound-sign (also called the number-sign).

ddd d#d ddd d#d ddd d#d ddd


d#d d#e d#d 3#c d#d #c# d#d
d#d cat d#d dog d#d eat d#d

Use your F-finger for the dollar-sign.

fff f$f fff f$f fff f$f fff


f$f r$v f$f v$4 f$f 4$r f$f
f$f rave f$f fare f$f $10.00 f$f
Joe keeps cryptic inventory bills like:  4# @ $5.00/# or 6# @ $4.50/#.

Use your F-finger for the percent sign as well.

fff f%f fff f%f fff f%f fff

If a $25.00 item is sold at a 10% discount, it will cost $22.50.
But, a 10% markup on a item selling for $22.50 is only $24.75!  How come?

Use your J-finger for the ampersand.

				THE END

You have now completed the T-series of these lessons.  If you have not already
done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.

There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.

The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
case).
