My totals were:  $2,309, $5,687, $3,498, $2,408, and $3,697.

A student may type 1 word per minute faster for each added
year of age: i.e., 13 to 14, to 15, to 16, to 17, to 18.

Often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
Many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
More than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.

Why do we all thrill over sports?  Maybe it is the tireless
skill of the winner that we feel.  Ask the players.  They
may agree (Rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.

"When you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
champion, Bobby Jones, "you know you can't afford to make
one careless slip."  A tired Bobby Jones (this was the way
Bobby told it to Rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
Smith by 18 strokes.

"Up to this point," says Bobby, "I had played 33 holes in 11
under par.  I believe it was the best golf I ever played in
my life.  But after easing up on the mental side I played
the last three holes in 5 over par."

In 1919 Babe Ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
Yet few know that the Babe worked five years in big games
before this start that led past Home Run #600.  You may
have cheered Jimmy Foxx and many another.  Yet you can still
picture the Babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
spot he had "called" a famous home run.

It is the effort against odds that thrills.  We feel these
drives that never let down.  We feel (this was the way Rice
put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
mind.  Can the fast typist afford to do less?  A typist has
to face such days of "mental torture" too.  Some days he has
to force himself along.  He need not punish his machine.  He
must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
way over all upsets.

(9A) Pointed Paragraph (m b)

     Men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
months.  Maybe Mr. Smith remembers that most building became
better in September but both November and December seemed to
be much behind.  Monday morning my mail box became blocked
by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
be built.  Some jobs may begin to come now from the Chamber
of Commerce members.

(10) Rhythmic Review

I said, "Never promise to take much money to such places."
