In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
This key is called the HOME position.

Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).

Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
cidentally press the key down.

Above the D-key is the E-key.  Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them again.
