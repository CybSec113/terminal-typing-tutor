For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
screen and instructions at the top of the screen.

All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.

When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
not to type an extra space at the end of the line.

If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.
